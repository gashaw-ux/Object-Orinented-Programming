# OOP Object-Oriented Programming

As the name implies, Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) refers to programming languages 
that use objects as a major source to accomplish what is to happen in the code. 
The viewer or user sees objects that are doing functions that you have assigned to them.
Object-oriented programming tries to implement real-world elements in programming 
such as inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, and so on.
The primary goal of OOP is to connect the data and the functions 
that act on it such that no other portion of the code may access the data except that function.

# Object
  - An object is any entity that has a state and behavior
  - a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming that represents real-life entities.
  -  A typical Java program creates many objects, which as you know, interact by invoking methods
  
 ## An object has three characteristics:
    - State: represents the data (value) of an object.
    - Behavior: represents the behavior (functionality) of an object such as deposit, withdraw, etc.
    - Identity: An object identity is typically implemented via a unique ID. The value of the ID is not visible to the external user. 
      However, it is used internally by the JVM to identify each object uniquely.
      
 ## For example, a bicycle is an object. It has

    States: idle, first gear, etc
    Behaviors: braking, accelerating, etc.
