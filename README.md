# OOP Object-Oriented Programming

As the name implies, Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) refers to programming languages 
that use objects as a major source to accomplish what is to happen in the code. 
The viewer or user sees objects that are doing functions that you have assigned to them.
Object-oriented programming tries to implement real-world elements in programming 
such as inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, and so on.
The primary goal of OOP is to connect the data and the functions 
that act on it such that no other portion of the code may access the data except that function.
