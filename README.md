# OOP Object-Oriented Programming

As the name implies, Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) refers to programming languages 
that use objects as a major source to accomplish what is to happen in the code. 
The viewer or user sees objects that are doing functions that you have assigned to them.
Object-oriented programming tries to implement real-world elements in programming 
such as inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, and so on.
The primary goal of OOP is to connect the data and the functions 
that act on it such that no other portion of the code may access the data except that function.

# Object
  - An object is any entity that has a state and behavior
  - a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming that represents real-life entities.
  -  A typical Java program creates many objects, which as you know, interact by invoking methods
  -  The object is an instance of a class.
  -  An object is a runtime entity.
  
 ## An object has three characteristics:
    - State: represents the data (value) of an object.
    - Behavior: represents the behavior (functionality) of an object such as deposit, withdraw, etc.
    - Identity: An object identity is typically implemented via a unique ID. The value of the ID is not visible to the external user. 
      However, it is used internally by the JVM to identify each object uniquely.
      
 ## An object consists of:

    A unique identity: Each object has a unique identity, even if the state is identical to that of another object.
    State/Properties/Attributes: State tells us how the object looks or what properties it has.
    Behavior: Behavior tells us what the object does.
      
 ## For example, a bicycle is an object. It has

    States: idle, first gear, etc
    Behaviors: braking, accelerating, etc.
    
 A class is a blueprint which you use to create objects. An object is an instance of a class - it's a concrete 'thing' that you made using a specific class. So, 'object' and 'instance' are the same thing, but the word 'instance' indicates the relationship of an object to its class.

This is easy to understand if you look at an example. For example, suppose you have a class House. Your own house is an object and is an instance of class House. Your sister's house is another object (another instance of class House).
